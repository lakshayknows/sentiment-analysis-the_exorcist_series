# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis of *The Exorcist* Series Reviews

This project is a submission for an **NLP internship assignment**. It demonstrates an **end-to-end sentiment analysis workflow** — from **scraping raw reviews** to **preprocessing, template engineering, and model interaction** with Hugging Face via **LangChain**.

The core deliverable is a **visual flowchart** illustrating the project lifecycle, complemented by this repository that houses the **source code, processed dataset, prompt templates, and detailed documentation**.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**

   * Scraped raw review data for *The Exorcist* series.
   * Preprocessed using **NLTK** & **TextBlob** for tokenization, lemmatization, and spelling correction.
   * Exported cleaned dataset → `processed_data.csv`.

2. **Prompt Engineering with LangChain**

   * Designed two prompting strategies:

     * **Prompt 1:** Direct, concise instructions.
     * **Prompt 2:** Role-playing, persona-based instructions.
   * Saved as reusable `.json` templates.

3. **Model Interaction**

   * Integrated with Hugging Face Hub model: **meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**.
   * LangChain orchestrates prompt-template loading, input handling, and inference.

4. **Evaluation & Troubleshooting**

   * Compared outputs from both strategies.
   * Documented differences & error cases in [`evaluation_and_troubleshooting.md`](evaluation_and_troubleshooting.md).

## 📊 Final Output Analysis

Sample Review:

```
"brings,back,,original,horror,,73"
```

**Result from Prompt 1 (Direct): ✅ Correct**

> Sentiment: **POSITIVE**
> Reasoning: Nostalgic reference to “original horror” implies enthusiasm and enjoyment.

**Result from Prompt 2 (Role-Playing): ❌ Incorrect**

> Sentiment: **NEGATIVE**
> Reasoning: Over-interpreted punctuation and fabricated a sense of disappointment.

👉 This comparison highlights how **prompt complexity can introduce hallucination**, and why **evaluation of prompt design** is crucial in NLP workflows.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-repository-name>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up API Credentials**

   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

     ```ini
     HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
     ```

5. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **pandas** → Data manipulation & preprocessing
* **NLTK & TextBlob** → Tokenization, lemmatization, spelling correction
* **LangChain** → Prompt engineering & orchestration
* **Hugging Face Hub** → Pre-trained LLM (meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)
* **Napkin.ai** → Visual flowchart for workflow illustration

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

* Even simple **prompt changes** can drastically affect model outputs.
* Role-playing prompts may **introduce bias or hallucination** in classification tasks.
* Clean preprocessing and controlled prompt strategies lead to more **reliable sentiment predictions**.

Would you like me to also **add sample code snippets** (like `app.py` execution or template creation) in the README so it looks even more hands-on for reviewers?
